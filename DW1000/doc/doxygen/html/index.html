RIOT in a nutshell                                        </h1>
<p>RIOT is an open-source microkernel-based operating system, designed to match the requirements of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and other embedded devices. These requirements include a very low memory footprint (on the order of a few kilobytes), high energy efficiency, real-time capabilities, communication stacks for both wireless and wired networks, and support for a wide range of low-power hardware.</p>
<p>RIOT provides a microkernel, multiple network stacks, and utilities which include cryptographic libraries, data structures (bloom filters, hash tables, priority queues), a shell and more. RIOT supports a wide range of microcontroller architectures, radio drivers, sensors, and configurations for entire platforms, e.g. Atmel SAM R21 Xplained Pro, Zolertia Z1, STM32 Discovery Boards etc. (see the list of <a href="https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/RIOT-Platforms">supported hardware</a>. Across all supported hardware (32-bit, 16-bit, and 8-bit platforms). RIOT provides a consistent API and enables ANSI C and C++ application programming, with multithreading, IPC, system timers, mutexes etc.</p>

Structure                                                          </h1>
<p>This section walks you through RIOT's structure. Once you understand this structure, you will easily find your way around in RIOT's code base.</p>
<div class="image">
<object type="image/svg+xml" data="riot-structure.svg" alt="Overview"></object>
</div>
<p>RIOT's code base is structured into five groups.</p>
<ul>
<li>The kernel (<code>core</code>)</li>
<li>Platform specific code (<code>cpu</code>; <code>boards</code>)</li>
<li>Device drivers (<code>drivers</code>)</li>
<li>Libraries and network code (<code>sys</code>; <code>pkg</code>)</li>
<li>Applications for demonstrating features and for testing (<code>examples</code>; <code>tests</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition RIOT includes a collection of scripts for various tasks (<code>dist</code>) as well as a predefined environment for generating this documentation (<code>doc</code>).</p>
<p>The structural groups are projected onto the directory structure of RIOT, where each of these groups resides in one or two directories in the main RIOT directory.</p>
<p>The following list gives a more detailed description of each of RIOT's top-level directories:</p>
<h2>core </h2>
<p>This directory contains the actual kernel. The kernel consists of the scheduler, inter-process-communication (messaging), threading, thread synchronization, and supporting data-structures and type definitions.</p>
<p>See <a class="el" href="dir_4270bfced15e0e73154b13468c7c9ad9.html">core</a> for further information and API documentations.</p>
<h2>boards </h2>
<p>The platform dependent code is split into two logic elements: CPUs and boards, while maintaining a strict 1-to-n relationship, a board has exactly one CPU, while a CPU can be part of n boards. The CPU part contains all generic, CPU specific code (see below).</p>
<p>The board part contains the specific configuration for the CPU it contains. This configuration mainly includes the peripheral configuration and pin-mapping, the configuration of on-board devices, and the CPU's clock configuration.</p>
<p>On top of the source and header files needed for each board, this directory additionally may include some script and configuration files needed for interfacing with the board. These are typically custom flash/debug scripts or e.g. OpenOCD configuration files. For most boards, these files are located in a <code>dist</code> sub-directory of the board.</p>
<p>See here <a class="el" href="dir_6c8313236d9db5b969ca7d150fe527de.html">boards</a> for further information.</p>
<h2>cpu </h2>
<p>For each supported CPU this directory contains a sub-directory with the name of the CPU. These directories then contain all CPU specific configurations, such as implementations of power management (LPM), interrupt handling and vectors, startup code, clock initialization code and thread handling (e.g. context switching) code. For most CPUs you will also find the linker scripts in the <code>ldscripts</code> sub-directory.</p>
<p>In the <code>periph</code> sub-directory of each CPU you can find the implementations of the CPU's peripheral drivers like SPI, UART, GPIO, etc. See drivers_periph for their API documentation.</p>
<p>Many CPUs share a certain amount of their code (e.g. all ARM Cortex-M based CPUs share the same code for task switching and interrupt handling). This shared code is put in its own directories, following a <code>xxxxx_common</code> naming scheme. Examples for this is code shared across architectures (e.g. <code>cortexm_common</code>, <code>msp430_comon</code>) or code shared among vendors (e.g. <code>kinetis_common</code>).</p>
<p>See <a class="el" href="group__cpu.html">Cpu</a> for more detailed informtation.</p>
<h2>drivers </h2>
<p>This directory contains the drivers for external devices such as network interfaces, sensors and actuators. Each device driver is put into its own sub-directory with the name of that device.</p>
<p>All of RIOT's device drivers are based on the peripheral driver API (e.g. SPI, GPIO, etc.) and other RIOT modules like the <code>xtimer</code>. This way the drivers are completely platform agnostic and they don't have any dependencies into the CPU and board code.</p>
<p>See <a class="el" href="dir_14bc92f4b96c8519b376567118ac28b3.html">drivers</a> for more details.</p>
<h2>sys </h2>
<p>RIOT follows the micro-kernel design paradigm where everything is supposed to be a module. All of these modules that are not part of the hardware abstraction nor device drivers can be found in this directory. The libraries include data structures (e.g. bloom, color), crypto libraries (e.g. hashes, AES) , high-level APIs (e.g. Posix implementations), memory management (e.g. malloc), the RIOT shell and many more.</p>
<p>See <a class="el" href="dir_a408b6d3a4a484720bc3ecfeac8947e3.html">sys</a> for a complete list of available libraries</p>
<h2>sys/net </h2>
<p>The <code>sys/net</code> sub-directory needs to be explicitly mentioned, as this is where all the networking code in RIOT resides. Here you can find the network stack implementations (e.g. the <a class="el" href="group__net__gnrc.html">GNRC</a> stack) as well as network stack agnostic code as header definitions or network types.</p>
<p>See net for more details on networking code.</p>
<h2>pkg </h2>
<p>RIOT comes with support for a number of external libraries (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/cn-uofbasel/ccn-lite">ccn-lite</a>, <a href="https://github.com/1248/microcoap">microcoap</a>). The way they are included is that RIOT ships with a custom Makefile for each supported library that downloads the library and optionally applies a number of patches to make it work with RIOT. These Makefiles and patches can be found in the <code>pkg</code> directory.</p>
<p>See <a class="el" href="dir_1b757248df2f96757224e5c7d0d8f21a.html">pkg</a> for a detailed description on how this works.</p>
<h2>examples </h2>
<p>Here you find a number of example applications that demonstrate certain features of RIOT. The default example found in this directory is a good starting point for anyone who is new to RIOT.</p>
<p>For more information best browse that directory and have a look at the <code>README.md</code> files that ship with each example.</p>
<p>To create your own application — here or anywhere else — see creating-an-application</p>
<h2>tests </h2>
<p>Many features/modules in RIOT come with their own test application, which are located in this directory. In contrary to the examples these tests are mostly focusing on a single aspect than on a set of features. Despite for testing, you might consider these tests also for insights on understanding RIOT.</p>
<h2>dist &amp; doc </h2>
<p>All the tooling around RIOT can be found in these two folders.</p>
<p><code>doc</code> contains the doxygen configuration and also contains the compiled doxygen output after running <code>make doc</code>.</p>
<p>Lastly, the <code>dist</code> directory contains tools to help you with RIOT. These include the serial terminal application <code>pyterm</code>, generic scripts for flashing, debugging, reseting (e.g. support for <a href="http://openocd.org/">OpenOCD</a>, <a href="https://www.segger.com/jlink_base.html">Jlink</a>), as well as code enabling easy integration to open testbeds such as the <a href="https://www.iot-lab.info/">IoT-LAB</a>. Furthermore you can find here scripts to do all kind of code and style checks. </p>
